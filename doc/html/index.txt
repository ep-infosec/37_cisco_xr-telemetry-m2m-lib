M2M API
*******

This collection of pages describes the external M2M Python API, which
gives access to the IOS-XR management plane intended for direct use by
Cisco customers. Example usage:

   from xrm2m import RootOper, connect

   conn = connect()
   for path, info in conn.get(RootOper.Interfaces):
       print(path["InterfaceName"], info["MTU"], info["ActualState"])

The interface also has facilities for operating asynchronously, and
remotely over SSH.

See *Usage examples* for more examples.

The main module exports are:

* Transport classes which define a method of connection to a remote
  router. Arguments include identifying information (eg. IP address)
  for the router in question, and user credentials as necessary.
  Currently only "SSHTransport" is supported, which uses SSH to
  connect to a router remotely.

* "connect()": Function to connect to a router, and return a
  "Connection" object. "Connection" objects have methods which perform
  manageability and schema requests/operations on the server (eg. get,
  set).

* "connect_async()": Asynchronous equivalent to "connect()" which
  returns a "AsyncConnection" object, which is an asynchronous
  equivalent of the "Connection" object. "async()" can be called on a
  "Connection" object to give the equivalent "Connection" object
  without creating a new underlying connection.

* "RootCfg" and "RootOper" which are "Path" objects, from which all
  other paths are created via attribute access and calling syntax.

Asynchronous functions and methods return *asyncio* *Future* objects
on Python 3, and Trollius *Future* objects on Python 2.
