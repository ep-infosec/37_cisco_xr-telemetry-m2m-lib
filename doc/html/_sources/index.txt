M2M API
^^^^^^^

This collection of pages describes the external M2M Python API, which gives
access to the IOS-XR management plane intended for direct use by Cisco
customers. Example usage:

.. sourcecode:: python

   from xrm2m import RootOper, connect

   conn = connect()
   for path, info in conn.get(RootOper.Interfaces):
       print(path["InterfaceName"], info["MTU"], info["ActualState"])

The interface also has facilities for operating asynchronously, and remotely
over SSH.

See :doc:`examples` for more examples.

The main module exports are:

- :func:`.connect`: Function to connect to a router, and return a
  :class:`.Connection` object. :class:`.Connection` objects have methods which
  perform manageability and schema requests/operations on the server (eg.  get,
  set).
- :func:`.connect_async`: Asynchronous equivalent to :func:`.connect` which
  returns a :class:`.AsyncConnection` object, which is an asynchronous
  equivalent of the :class:`.Connection` object. :func:`.sync` can be called
  on a :class:`.AsyncConnection` object to give the equivalent
  :class:`.Connection` object without creating a new underlying connection.
- :data:`.RootCfg` and :data:`.RootOper` which are :class:`.Path` objects,
  from which all other paths are created via attribute access and calling
  syntax.
- Transport classes which define a method of connection to a remote router.
  Arguments include identifying information (eg. IP address) for the router in
  question, and user credentials as necessary. Currently only
  :class:`.SSHTransport` is supported, which uses SSH to connect to a router
  remotely.

Asynchronous functions and methods return `asyncio` `Future` objects on Python
3, and Trollius_ `Future` objects on Python 2.
