This provides a Go library to access the experimental IOS XR M2M API, and a few
examples to manage streaming telemetry or do other actions.

You can either build a Docker container with all the dependencies, or just
manually run:

  go get github.com/ScriptRock/crypto/ssh
  go get github.com/kr/pretty
  go get github.com/abiosoft/ishell

The special crypto/ssh dependency is because the standard crypto/ssh doesn't
have aes128-cbc support at the time of writing, which is required for
communicating with some IOS XR releases.
